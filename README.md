# HTMLAssessment

HTML Assessment is a demo website to start learning HTML. We were instructed on the format of the page and not to use CSS. It is to include a Lorem Ipsum (of our choosing), a table, a list and a form.


# Technologies Used

Atom - HTML - Git - GitHub

# Concepts Used
HTML language - head - body - divisions - paragraphs - headers - colors - indentation - bold using <strong> - italics - underlining - block quote - lists with bullet points - margins using style.


# What I learned
This was my first time using HTML and I feel like I have a good understanding of the language and how it works in tandem with CSS and Java. My understanding of Java is better now that I see how it can work in real-life application with other languages.
